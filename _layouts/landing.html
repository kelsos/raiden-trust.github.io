        The Raiden Trust is an external development grant programme managing 16
        million RDN tokens to support projects which contribute to the Raiden
        ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        Projects will be supported via financial means, guidance and the Raiden
        Trustâ€™s network in the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        The Raiden Trust has been founded on XX/XX/XX as an independent entity. <br>
        The Raiden Trust is not to be confused with brainbot labs Est. (BBLE), which is 
        the entity building the Raiden Network. So while both BBLE and the Raiden Trust
        work towards building and improving Raiden the Raiden ecosystem, it is important 
        not note the Raiden Trust is in full control of the 16 million RDN tokens and 
        independent of BBLE. If you are interested in learning more about the legal setup, 
        please read our Raiden Trust announcement (INSERT LINK).
