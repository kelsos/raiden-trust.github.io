        The Raiden Trust is an external development grant programme managing 16
        million RDN tokens to support projects which contribute to the Raiden
        ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        Projects will be supported via financial means, guidance and the Raiden
        Trustâ€™s network in the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        The Raiden Trust has been founded on XX/XX/XX as an independent entity.
        The Raiden Network is being built by brainbot labs Est. (BBLE) which is a 
        completely separate entity to that of the Raiden trust. So while the Raiden 
        Trust is in full control of the 16 million RDN tokens dedicated to support 
        the Raiden ecosystem, it is independent of BBLE. If you are interested in 
        learning more about the legal setup, please read our Raiden Trust announcement.
